==Downloading==

Google Code's recommended download process is a bad idea, as it will get you a directory with the name "django-template-utils". A better tactic is to do this:

{{{
svn checkout http://django-template-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ template_utils
}}}

If you've already done a checkout using the Google Code instructions, rename the "django-template-utils" directory to "template_utils" -- if you don't, things will break.

==Installing==

Assuming you've done the SVN checkout from somewhere that's on your Python path, just add `template_utils` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.
