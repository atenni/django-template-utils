The Django template system includes built-in tags for comparing equality, but not for doing less-than/greater-than comparisons, so `template_utils` provides a tag library called `comparison` which implements this functionality.

The full set of tags is as follows:

  * `if_less`
  * `if_less_or_equal`
  * `if_greater`
  * `if_greater_or_equal`

Each tag can have an optional `else` clause, and follows this syntax:

{{{
{% if_less var1 var 1 %}
...do something...
{% else %}
...do something else...
{% endif_less %}
}}}

In all cases, `var1` and `var2` can be template variables or literal values; for example, the following (which might appear inside a `for` loop, and uses one of each) will work:

{{{
{% if_greater_or_equal forloop.counter 4 %}
<p>This is at least the fifth time through the loop.</p>
{% else %}
<p>This is one of the first four times through the loop.</p>
{% endif_greater_or_equal %}
}}}
